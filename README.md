# Video-Game-Randomizer

## Description

This is an application that picks a random game from a list that the user provides

-Motivation: When we get together to play a game, we often have a hard time deciding which game to play.
-We built this project to shorten the amount of time we spend deciding which game to play, which leaves us with more time to actually play. 
-After the user enters a list of possible games, the application will pick one game at random from the list that was provided. 

## Installation

Our application can be installed through github.

## Usage

1. Enter a game you'd like to play into the specified text box, then hit the 'Enter' key on your keyboard. This will populate your game to the list.
2. Repeat step 1 for each game you are thinking about playing.
3. After you have entered all the games you wish to add, click the 'Randomize!' button found above the list of games. The application will choose a random game from the list you provided.
4. If you wish to remove a game from your list for any reason, click the 'Remove' button directly to the right of the game you wish to remove from the list.
